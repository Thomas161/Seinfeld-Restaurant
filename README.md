# This is my Javascript project that i completed for General Assembly

The Project uses the Firebase cloud platform, there exists 2 databases one for reservations and the other for guest feedback, that handle the raw storage to back end.

I also implemented the google maps API in order to provide a topographical location for fake restaurant.

Other logic include clearing data on submit, and redirecting to home page.
