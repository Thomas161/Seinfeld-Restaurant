# Mock Restaurant

![Larry David](https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm-fashion.html)

This was my first major project, it was a restaurant simulated app. As a massive fan of Seinfeld i built a fake Seinfeld restaurant book app using Javascript that is integrated with Firbase Realtime DB.
